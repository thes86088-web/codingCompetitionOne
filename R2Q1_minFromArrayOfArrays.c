/*
Input Provided :
int arr[][] or int **arr
(positive integers)

Output Expected :
the integer with minimum value from the given 2D array
*/

/*
Approach-1 : Searching using Nested Loops
*/


/*
Approach-2 : Searching by dividing into Halves
constraint: int* is preferrable over int[][]
dis_adv : recursive approach
*/

/*
Approach-3 : Unfolding ( int arr[][] --> int *arr ) and performing linear search 
dis_adv :  : has to visit every element twice ( once for unfolding and once for searching )
*/
